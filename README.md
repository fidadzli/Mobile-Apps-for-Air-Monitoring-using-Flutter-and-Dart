# Mobile-Application-for-Air-Monitoring-using-Flutter-and-Dart
I have developed a mobile application specifically tailored for quadcopter drones equipped with four sensors positioned between each propeller. The application has the capability to expand its functionality to accommodate up to eight sensors. It is meticulously designed for real-time data analysis and visualization of gas sensor readings while the drone is hovering. This mobile application was built using Flutter and Dart for development.
